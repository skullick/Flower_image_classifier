# Flower Image Classifier
This project builds a deep learning model using transfer learning to classify images of flowers into different categories. The dataset contains images of various flower species, which is divided into training, validation, and testing sets to train and evaluate the model. This project uses the VGG-16 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tunes it to recognize specific flower species. The code for the project was developed using Jupyter Notebook and converted to a command-line application.
